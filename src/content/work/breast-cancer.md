### Episode Summary

To mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we are joined in this moving and potentially life-saving mdtalk by Sheila Mikhail, Executive Director of Columbus Children’s Foundation and Co-Founder and Advisor at Ask Bio.

Sheila is a Lawyer, Business Leader, and Philanthropist. She received her Doctor of Law in Business Commerce from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1997. She has been featured in the <a href="https://themedicinemaker.com/awards/power-list/2023">Medicine Maker 2023 Power List</a>, and, among many other accolades, was selected as EY Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernest & Young in Nov 2021.

Sheila received a breast cancer diagnosis and after experiencing life-changing health inequality and an extraordinarily difficult journey to diagnosis and appropriate treatment, Sheila focused her efforts on philanthropy and advocacy by founding BC-Ruckus.

BC-Ruckus seeks to increase awareness of breast cancer screening and diagnosis, as well as to campaign for equal access to potentially life-saving screenings that are not currently available to many in the US.
